# Stain Normalization
H&amp;E slides color normalisation using generative adversarial networks<br>
Academic project<br>
Code based on StainGAN rep: https://github.com/xtarx/StainGAN

# How to use the code?
To run training and testing, just download the `train_test.ipynb` notebook and open it with Google Colab.<br>
In the notebook, we first download the data and split it in train/test (possibly val).<br>
Once data is split, we run training and testing based on their respective config files.
